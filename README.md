bartelsStewartMatlab
====================


A basic MATLAB implementation of the Bartels-Stewart algorithm for solving 

```
AXB' + CXD' = E
```
where `A`, `C` are `mxm` matrices, `B` and `D` are `nxn` matrices, and `E` is an `mxn` matrix

We do not claim that this is the best implementation of the Bartels-Stewart algorithm or that this is the best algorithm for solving `AXB' + CXD' = E`.
